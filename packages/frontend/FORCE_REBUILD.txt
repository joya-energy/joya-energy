This file triggers a Vercel rebuild to pick up environment variables.

CRITICAL CHECKLIST BEFORE THIS BUILD:
======================================

1. Vercel Environment Variables are set EXACTLY:
   NG_APP_API_URL=https://joya-backend-production.up.railway.app/api
   NG_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=AIzaSyBls9111rmwlK89NjAaqVRHMEhJdzeZs9Q

2. Variables are applied to: All (Production, Preview, Development)

3. Variable names are EXACT (with NG_APP_ prefix)

After this commit is pushed, Vercel will rebuild and the environment 
variables MUST be picked up.

If the build still shows:
  apiUrl: '/api'
  
Then the environment variables are NOT set correctly in Vercel.
